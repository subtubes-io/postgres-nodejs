# Pre-requisites

- Be sure to have NodeJS installed (tested on v20.10.0)
- Make sure you have Docker installed and be able to run `docker compose up`
- Scripts are meant to run on MacOSx Apple Silicon (might run on Intel)

# Getting Started

- Run `./cmd.sh init`

# Known Issues

- npm install might fail because you do not have postgres intalled. The `pg` and `postgres` packages from nodejs require postgres to be installed :(
